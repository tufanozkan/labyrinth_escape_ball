# labyrinth_espace_ball

      The goal of the game is to first solve the maze, and then try to escape from the maze within a set time limit by moving a ball with the arrow keys without hitting the walls of the maze. While developing this project, I used a few different methods and UnityEngine library.
Usage:
•Collision detection
•Camera tracking
•Rigidbody
